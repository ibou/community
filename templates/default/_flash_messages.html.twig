{#
This is a template fragment designed to be included in other templates
See https://symfony.com/doc/current/book/templating.html#including-other-templates

A common practice to better distinguish between templates and fragments is to
prefix fragments with an underscore. That's why this template is called
'_flash_messages.html.twig' instead of 'flash_messages.html.twig'

{#
The request method check is needed to prevent starting the session when looking for "flash messages":
https://symfony.com/doc/current/session/avoid_session_start.html

TIP: With FOSHttpCache you can also adapt this to make it cache safe:
